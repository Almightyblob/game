                    <p>Oh no! Vadid and his little brother Blimsy fell through a magical portal! Can you help them find their way home?</p>
                    <p>You play as Vadid (red rectangle). Blimsy (blue rectangle) will follow you wherever you go. However, unlike you, Blimsy can't jump! 
                        Sometimes you will need to pick him up to overcome obstacles. In order to pick up Blimsy, you will need to stand close to each other (Blimsy will turn yellow to let you know he's ready to be picked up).
                    But be aware: when you carry Blimsy, you cannot jump that high anymore!</p>
